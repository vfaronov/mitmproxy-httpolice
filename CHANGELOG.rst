Changelog
=========

All notable changes to mitmproxy-HTTPolice will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_
(which means it is unstable until 1.0).


0.6.0 - 2017-03-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
-----
- A new ``--tail`` option to regenerate the report on every new exchange,
  so you can inspect traffic as it comes (see `docs`_).

- HTTPolice now writes brief summaries to mitmproxy’s event log, like this::

    HTTPolice found 1 errors, 2 comments in: GET /api/v1/ - 200 OK

  (The event log is printed to the console when you use ``mitmdump``,
  or to the “Event log” pane when you press the ‘e’ key in ``mitmproxy``.)

- In the ``mitmproxy`` console UI, you can now see a brief report
  for every individual exchange on its “Detail” pane (see `docs`_).

.. _docs: http://mitmproxy-httpolice.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Changed
-------
- The output file is now specified with the ``-w`` option instead of
  just a positional argument, for example::

    $ mitmdump -s "`python3 -m mitmproxy_httpolice` -w report.txt"

  This ``-w`` option is actually *optional*: you can omit it
  if you only want to view the reports in the console UI, for example.


0.5.1 - 2017-02-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed an error that happened on many/most HTTP/2 requests
(those without a Host header).


0.5.0 - 2017-01-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No interesting changes; just update docs and packaging
for better compatibility with Python 3.6 and mitmproxy 1.0.
This version also drops support for Python 2. If you need Python 2,
use ``mitmproxy==0.18.2`` and ``mitmproxy-HTTPolice==0.4.0``.


0.4.0 - 2016-10-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release is compatible with mitmproxy 0.18+, and **only** 0.18+
(because mitmproxy 0.18 has a new, backward-incompatible API).
Note that mitmproxy (and thus mitmproxy-HTTPolice) now supports Python 3.5+.


0.3.0 - 2016-08-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Technical release. No interesting changes.


0.2.0 - 2016-05-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initial release as a separate distribution.
